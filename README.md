- Accessor method: Gets and returns the value of an instance variable
- Mutator method: Sets the instance variable to a value in its parameter
- Constructor: Initializes the instance variables to values
- public is accessible from outside the class
- private is not accessible from outside the class

- The scope of a variable is defined as where a variable is accessible or can be used. The scope is determined by where you declare the variable when you write your programs. When you declare a variable, look for the closest enclosing curly braces ({}) â€“ this is its scope.


- Java has 3 levels of scope that correspond to different types of variables:
-   Class Level Scope for instance variables inside a class.
-   Method Level Scope for local variables (including parameter variables) inside a method.
-   Block Level Scope for loop variables and other local variables defined inside of blocks of code with { }.


- The keyword this can be used in a class to refer to the current calling object.
- Mutator methods should have a void return type.

- Class - A class defines a type and is used to define what all objects of that class know and can do.
- Compiler - Software that translates the Java source code (ends in .java) into the Java class file (ends in .class).
- Compile time error - An error that is found during the compilation. These are also called syntax errors.
- Constructor - Used to initialize fields in a newly created object.
- Field - A field holds data or a property - what an object knows or keeps track of.
- Java - A programming language that you can use to tell a computer what to do.
- Main Method - Where execution starts in a Java program.
- Method - Defines behavior - what an object can do.
- Object - Objects do the actual work in an object-oriented program.
- Syntax Error - A syntax error is an error in the specification of the program.
